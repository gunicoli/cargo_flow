# cargo_flow

## Gettting Started
This is a prototype of the cargo flow business model through which we will gauge market attractiveness

Cargo Flow is company that comes from a Web 3.0 mentality where privacy, speed and information are the key thing. 
As a prototype we will structure the product to be run using a pre-launch marketing strategy through which we would like to understand consumer behavior, consumer feedback and many other indicators that may be relevant to appropiately gauge the value adding potential for the market model. 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, in case you have been hired as a freelancer, and the wiki section shall break down any relevant information that comes along as the project goes through development. 

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
