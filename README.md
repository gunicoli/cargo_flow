# Cargo Flow: Logistics Sulotions Developments

## Gettting Started
This is a prototype of the cargo flow business model through which we will gauge market attractiveness

As a prototype we will structure the product to be run as a pre-launch

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system (later)
